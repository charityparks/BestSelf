# README
This app is all about bettering yourself!  I have listed several categories. You can hover over the category to see the list of activities that have been added to it.  
Click on 'Click here for BestSelf activities!' to generate a list of things to focus on for the day to live your best self.  After the days list is generated, the next day those activities will no longer exist in the database.  This way you won't be doing the same activities over and over.  The list will eventally be empty when you've run out of activities.  To ensure this doesn't happen, make sure to add new activities to your list often.  At 'New Activity', use the text box to type in a new activity, then from the dropdown box select a category to store it in. Then click the submit button.
I've added some inspirational quotes from famous people to help you along your journey to achieve your BestSelf.  Enjoy!

This app uses:  Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS
